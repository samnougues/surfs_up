- The mean temperature is about 4 degrees higher in June (approx 75) than in December(approx 71).
- The minimum temperature is 8 degrees higher in June(64) than in December (56)
- The maximum temperature is 2 degrees higher in June(85) than in December (83)
It seems like temperatures are relatively mild all year round, which is great for an ice cream shop or a surf shop.
## Summary:

- There isn't much difference between the temperatures in June and December. As seen in the photos above. 
- Another query I could add is looking at data on wind speed. Windy days could affect sales.
- In addition to the query above, we could also look at whether or not precipitation would be higher or lower in June and December
