- The mean temperature is about 4 degrees higher in June (aprox 75) than in December(aprox 71).
- The minimun temperature is 8 degrees higher in June(64) than in December (56)
- The maximun temperature is 2 degrees higher in June(85) than in December (83)
It seem like temperatures are fairly mild all year roud which is great for an ice cream shop or a surf shop.
## Summary:

- There isn't much difference between the temperatures in JUne and December. As seen in the photos above. 
- Another query I could add is looking at data on wind speed. Windy days could effect sales.
- In addition to the query above we could alos look at the whether or not precipitation would be higher or lower in June and December
